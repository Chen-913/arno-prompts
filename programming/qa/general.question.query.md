I want to have a engineering platform for dev, ops, delivery and security.
This platform is for an engineering internal usage of DingTalk team.
It should be a platform for all the engineering team members to collaborate.
This project is named `混合钉钉` in Chinese, it is specialized for private cloud or mixed cloud devOps.

Now we want to have a portal-site domain, with the style of *.dingtalk.com.

Try to give me some suggestions about the domain name which should be simple and easy to remember.
