## Examples

https://poe.com/react-dev-arno

This is my react related code:

```tsx

import React from 'react';
import { ComposeFnCtx } from './compose-api-route';

export type NextServerPageParams = {
  params: { [slug: string]: string };
  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined };
};

export type ComposeServerPageFunction = (nextParams: NextServerPageParams, reqContext: ComposeFnCtx) => Promise<any>;

export function composeServerPage(Page: React.FC<NextServerPageParams & {
  context: ComposeFnCtx;
}>, fns: any[] = []) {
  const context = new Map();
  return async function MiddlewareChainedPageServer({ params, searchParams } : NextServerPageParams) {
    for await (const fn of fns) {
      const fnResult = await fn({ params, searchParams }, context);
      if (fnResult) {
        /**
         * if middleware returns a value, it means it wants to stop the chain
         * return the value as the result of the page
         */
        return fnResult as React.ReactNode;
      }
    }
    return Page({
      params,
      searchParams,
      context,
    });
  }
}
```

it indicate the type error `Type is referenced directly or indirectly in the fulfillment callback of its own then method.` of 
`MiddlewareChainedPageServer` how can I solve it?
